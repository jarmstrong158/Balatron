"""Pillar 2 (dec-034 PLANNING): evaluate build decisions by their MULTI-ANTE
future consequences instead of immediate score.

Balatro is fully observable with a deterministic scoring model, so we can
SIMULATE forward — the computer's superpower the agent has never used. The
reactive policy + greedy `_estimate_joker_value` rank a shop joker by how much
it raises THIS hand's score; that's a ~ante-4 strategy. This module ranks a buy
by how much deeper into the ante blind-target curve the resulting build can go
("survivability") — the question a strong player actually asks at the shop.

First slice = depth-1 planning with a multi-ante horizon evaluation, built on the
now-accurate Pillar-1 valuation (`estimate_score_for_hand_type`, which already
projects scaling-joker growth). Full multi-step expectimax (reroll/draw chance
nodes, RL value head as the leaf) is a later refinement within this pillar.
